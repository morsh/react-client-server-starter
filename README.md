```

# Build

```sh

# Production

For this sample to run in production you'll need:

1. To build the solution using `npm run build`
2. To run `npm start` to start the server (The client is only used during development and testing)

To do that you'll have to take one of the following appoaches:

1. Build in dev (or other pre-prod) environment, check-in the `./build` folder
2. Build in production - this will require running `npm install` and is not advisable
