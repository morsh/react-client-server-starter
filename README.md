# Ibex Dashboard [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Azure/ibex-dashboard.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Azure/ibex-dashboard)


[Ibex](http://aka.ms/ibex) is a dashboarding application that enables building dashboard and templates.
It mainly supports **Application Insights** but data sources and visual components are easily extendable.

## Changes

### Version 1.3 (January 22, 2018)

Version 1.3 contains the following changes:

* Moving application insights queries from client to server
* Updated tests to answer some security risks presented by GitHub
* Updated tests to accommodate the new approach
* Added masking/unmasking of connection parameters (so that client side can only update API KEY but not see what it is)
* Fixed small bugs with Firefox rendering

### Version 1.2 (October 16, 2017)
Version 1.2 breaks the persitency paths of dashboard files and custom templates. If you are upgrading to this version, copy your private dashboards from `/dashboards` into `/dashboards/persistent/` as follows: 

> Private Files: Move files from `/dashboards/*.private.js` to `/dashboards/persistent/private`.

> Custom Templates: Move files from `/dashboards/customTemplates/*.private.ts` to `/dashboards/persistent/customTemplates`.

</a>

### 3. Manual

1. Fork this repo (to be able to automatically create github deployment key)
2. Clone & Deploy:
3. [Create a new Web App in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/app-service-continuous-deployment)

# Deploy With Docker

1. `docker build -t **image name** .`
2. `docker run -d -e PORT=80 **image name** `
3. Docker image is also available at Docker Hub - `docker pull morshemesh/ibex-dashboard`

# Application Insights Integration

Since application insights API doesn't support ARM yet, we need to manually [create an API Key](https://dev.applicationinsights.io/documentation/Authorization/API-key-and-App-ID) for the application insights service.
The full instructions are also available when you create a new dashboard.

You can also follow the next headline.

### Create new API Key and Application ID

The following steps explain how to connect **Application Insights** bot with your bot and your dashboard:
[you can also follow the [official Application Insights article](https://dev.applicationinsights.io/documentation/Authorization/API-key-and-App-ID)].

1. Go to [azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Select: **Resource Groups** > **[new resource group]** > **App Insights Service**
3. Copy **Instrumentation Key** and paste into your bot registration page (on the bottom)
4. Click: **API Access** > **Create New Key** > **+ Read Telemetry**
5. Copy `Application ID` + `API Key`
6. Open the URL of your web app
7. Under **AppId**/**ApiKey** set the values you created.

### Adding Application Insights instrumentation to your bot
- [Instrumentation for Node.js bots](https://github.com/Azure/botbuilder-instrumentation)
- [Instrumentation for C# bots](https://github.com/Azure/botbuilder-instrumentation-cs)

# Testing
The test watcher is integrated into the create-react-app mechanism and runs tests related to files changes since the last commit.

To run the test watcher in an interactive mode:

```bash
cd client
yarn test
```

Alternatively, you can also run the full commands that the Travis CI server
will run to validate any changes.

```bash
.travis/ci.sh
```

# Build
Our CI server Travis creates new production builds automatically for changes
to master. If you need to create a build locally, you can execute the same
commands as the CI server.

```bash
yarn build
```

Or

```bash
.travis/build.sh
```
